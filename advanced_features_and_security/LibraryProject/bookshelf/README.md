# Django Permissions & Groups Setup

## Custom Permissions
- Added to `Book` model:
  - can_view
  - can_create
  - can_edit
  - can_delete

## Groups
- **Viewers** → can_view
- **Editors** → can_view, can_create, can_edit
- **Admins** → can_view, can_create, can_edit, can_delete

## Enforcement
- Views use `@permission_required` decorators:
  - book_list → requires can_view
  - book_create → requires can_create
  - book_edit → requires can_edit
  - book_delete → requires can_delete

## Testing
1. Create users in Admin.
2. Assign them to groups.
3. Log in and confirm access matches permissions.
